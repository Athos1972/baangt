``baangt`` In Industries
=========================

``baangt`` is versatile and useful for producers and consumers of software from all walks of life. Some industries though
have specific needs, that are especially well addressed by ``baangt`` out of the box.

``baangt`` in Banking
---------------------

Banks often have large system landscapes, diversified customers and products. It often looks like each individual
customer has it's own set of parameters and business processes within the bank`s organization. KYC-Initiatives,
PEP/FATCA compliance and a lot of regulatory demands must be fulfilled. On the other hand apps and online banking bring
direct communications with end customers. It's nearly impossible to test all processes in all combinations before a new
increment is released to production.

This huge complexity and vast amounts of test cases make it an ideal environment for ``baangt`` to shine! Closer
collaboration between IT-Departments and business people helps to avoid misunderstandings and find different interpretations
of requirements early in the process - and long before reaching production systems.

Creating test cases in simple Excel sheets and communicating based on those expected results will streamline test
processes and support project organizations to deliver better results in shorter time.

Insurance and ``baangt``
------------------------

Insurance is like banking on steroids - at least when it comes to complexity of the products, processes and system
landscapes. Due to the variety of products (Life, P&C, Health, Car/Automotive) and the completely different processes
for each of the product lines testing in insurance companies is complex and challenging. As in many other industries
trends of recent years like off-shoring, near-shoring and outsourcing lead to less understanding of the business needs
by service providers but also to less understanding of the underlying complexity when service providers extend or change
existing code bases, which makes testing even more important as side-effects are more likely than back in the days when
the internal IT people of the company knew exactly what they were dealing with.

Business departments especially since the last 5 years, but also during the next 5-10 years face challenges due to
overaged work force. Companies manage to bring in young talents to take over the responsibility of insurance
products development and maintenance of existing product landscape. At the same time they are competing on a global market,
operating inside a strictly defined legal range and need to cut down costs and innovate products to fit modern customer
needs.
