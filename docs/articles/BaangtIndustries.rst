``baangt`` In Industries
=========================

``baangt`` is versatile and useful for producers and consumers of software from all walks of life. Some industries though
have specific needs, that are especially well addressed by ``baangt`` out of the box.

``baangt`` in Banking
---------------------

Banks often have large system landscapes, diversified customers and products. It often looks like each individual
customer has it's own set of parameters and business processes within the bank`s organization. KYC-Initiatives,
PEP/FATCA compliance and a lot of regulatory demands must be fulfilled. On the other hand apps and online banking bring
direct communications with end customers. It's nearly impossible to test all processes in all combinations before a new
increment is released to production.

This huge complexity and vast amounts of test cases make it an ideal environment for ``baangt`` to shine! Closer
collaboration between IT-Departments and business people helps to avoid misunderstandings and find different interpretations
of requirements early in the process - and long before reaching production systems.

Creating test cases in simple Excel sheets and communicating based on those expected results will streamline test
processes and support project organizations to deliver better results in shorter time.

Insurance and ``baangt``
------------------------

Insurance is like banking on steroids - at least when it comes to complexity of the products, processes and system
landscapes.
