<h1>Why your production sucks and how to fix it<a class="headerlink" href="#why-your-production-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Sounds familiar? When you sort your defects/incident list for the next sprint, you abandon priority concept (1, 2, 3)
and start experimenting with negative numbers? -1, -2 -3? Your sprint capacity is full before you even reach priority 0?</p>
<p>Each day/week when you’re supposed to ship the most important hotfixes to production you suddenly beome religious and pray
intensively for 30 minutes? But the universe doesn’t listen to you and 30 Minutes after deployment hell breaks loose
because you again bricked the production?</p>
<p>First of all: Breathe! Changing religion will not improve your situation (unless you go “all-in”,
start as a full-time monk and leave software development forever.). <strong>You are not alone</strong>. I can’t come up with trustworthy
numbers, but I’d guess that at any given second of the day at least 1000 people pray for good deployment results. It’s
a phenomenon that we had already in the 1990s, just the impact back then was never as huge as it is today. There existed
manual fallback processes in all companies. Nobody “needed” the IT. If you had a bad deployment and needed to rollback and it
took one week to do so, it wasn’t the end of the world, the company or you.</p>
<p>Today is different. Well, I’m pretty sure even if facebook is down for a week, the world would still turn. And facebook
facebook wouldn’t cease to exist. I’m not so sure about a few 1000 people, who’d be responsible for the mess though.</p>
<p>Well, let’s not focus on what could happen (and usually happens because Murphy’s a very special friend to many people in
IT), but rather see, what we can do about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We all know, that there’s test automation, which should theoretically give us enough insight on lower stages before we move to Production.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Tricentis Tosca is the market leader and has been around for a few decades. So have the solutions from
HP and many others. As good as these tools are, in order to gain value from them you better follow certain processes, none of
which would be suitable for your business department or your developers. So both parties, who are in pain when deployments
don’t work have a direct interface to the tool, that should help them. There are test-engineers, test-planners, test-designers,
test-executors and most probably repalled DevOps involved in the automation testing, but not the business department and not
the developers. That’s critical from my point of view, because those processes build a barrier, that prohibits automation testing
to fulfill it’s potential in todays organizations.</p>
<p>Enter: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baangt</span></code>. Leightweight, fast, simple. Easy to use for business deparments, fast and flexible for developers (they
even get to play around with beloved JSON-Files) and mature enough for established Delivery organizations to fulfill their
needs of reporting and integration.</p>
<p>Before you try every Sect on the planet give <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baangt</span></code> a try. If set-up and used properly, this tool has a good chance
to make your life better and easier.</p>
