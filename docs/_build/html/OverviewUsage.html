<h1>What is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baangt</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-baangt" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Testing software has always been a challenging field and it’s not getting easier or simpler as overall complexity in corporate
and other applications skyrockets. Release cycles in larger corporations are often long because of inefficient regression
tests. Also costs of software updates, upgrades and forward development is heavily impacted by too little test coverage.</p>
<p><strong>To stop praying when you release to production you need to start serious testing!</strong></p>
<p>With <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baangt</span></code> you’ve one <em>open source</em> solution for all your test stages and needs. Be it Frontend with Webbrowser, API,
graphQL, SOAP, oData or chromium related App-Tests. You’ll use one toolset, one database per stage and one reporting to
see at any given moment, how your stages and applications are doing and if it’s safe to release the current state of one
stage to the next.</p>

<div><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baangt</span></code> is optimized to be super easy to start and flexible when your demand grows.</p>

<h2>The fastest, simplest way to record test cases<a class="headerlink" href="#the-fastest-simplest-way-to-record-test-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If your requirements are pretty basic you’d start using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baangt</span></code> with a simple Excel-Sheet as source of Testcase definition and
Testdata definition. This is super fast, very easy even for endusers but has limited flexibility, even though it comes packed
with all features of the higher end solutions like reporting, fault tolerance, screenshots in case of errors and much more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="still-simple-and-more-powerful-ways">
<h2>Still simple and more powerful ways:<a class="headerlink" href="#still-simple-and-more-powerful-ways" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As your requirements grow you’d have Testcase and testrun definition separately (e.g. you want to execute the same
test cases on different stages of your system landscape (Pre-Quality, Final-Quality, Dev) and not for every heartbeat test
you’d want to run through your 1000s of test data. Maybe you’ll have a SQL-Query in your Excel based data, which changes
data records dynamically or per stage or per version, that you want to test for. Things are not so simple in this stage,
but still simple enough for technically versed business department to run high quality tests on all stages by themselves.
Even after the point, where you need technicians to integrate baangt with your CD/CI-Pipeline`s buildmanagement tools,
the maintenance of data and test sequence can be done without ANY other tools (except Excel or OpenOffice) easily by the
people who know best what to test: Your business department.</p>
<div class="section" id="hey-why-not-do-everything-in-excel">
<h3>Hey, why not do everything in Excel?<a class="headerlink" href="#hey-why-not-do-everything-in-excel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is one serious drawback from this flexibilty: it’s change. Of course you started with 1 sheet, but later had some additional
requirements and simply added a second sheet to cover those whithout changing the definitions of the first excel sheet.
You’re still happy as you need both behaviours tested (imagine one test set for regional customers and another test set
for customers from other countries). Great. Everything works. After having some serious problems in production and fixing
those defects you decide to write a testcase to mimic a certain user behaviour (e.g. navigating back and forth multiple
times, deleting and re-adding objects from a shopping chart, etc.). The basic test sequence would be still the same as in
the other two cases, but for a specific card you’ll need changes. Simple. You copy one of the original sheets and adjust
accordingly. You immediately sleep better because now also those cases are part of your growing regression test set. Wonderful.
You continue like this for 2 months, end up with 2 or 3 datafiles and 20 test case definitions. That’s not uncommon. Also
not uncommon is “Change”. For more direct communication with the endusers the AUT (Application under test) get’s enriched
with a Sentry-Popup. Wonderful idea. But wait… It’s not so great after all, because now you have to update 20 test case
definitions with a way to deal with the new popup. Imagine corporate environments where we have many 1.000 or many 10.000
tests.</p>

<div class="section" id="baangtdb-for-flexible-powerful-enterprise-grade-test-automation">
<h2><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BaangtDB</span></code> for flexible, powerful enterprise grade test automation<a class="headerlink" href="#baangtdb-for-flexible-powerful-enterprise-grade-test-automation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Enter the next stage: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baangtDB</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baangtDB</span></code> does much more than just replace Excel as input and sequence source. BaangtDB
provides modularization of your test cases. In the above example you’d maintain the Sentry-Popup exactly ONCE for all your
test cases, where it applies.</p>
<p>Also if you’re in a really large corporate environment, you’ll start facing problems with the XLS-Based solution as corporate
governance, compliance, regulations and so on will sooner or later make it difficult to use the software in this way. Also
even if you use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code> you experience problems with different versions of the Excel-Sheets - depending on your setup of course.</p>
<p>But still no need invest into expensive, licensed, closed source, proprietary solutions and depend on their good will.
Run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baangtDB</span></code> (for testdata and testcase sequences) in a docker container on premises or in Cloud and have the full flexibility plus
comfort for free.</p>
