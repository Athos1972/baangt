Future Features
===============
We implement all features for 3 operating Systems (Mac, Windows, Ubuntu and Ubuntu on Docker).

Short/Medium term features
---------------------------
* Improve template for TestCaseDefinitions
* Better support for scraping
* Improved reporting on test runs/Test cases, etc.
* Improved handling of test data base entities (e.g. use-counters for each object)


Features for later
------------------
* Asynchronous test case continuation after paused test case status (V2.0)
* Double Opt-In Automation (so far no 'takers')
* Proof of concept with PyWinAuto
* Integration with SAP Gui Scripting via VBS and PyWinAuto
* Improved support for Mass testing APIs
* Katalon Importer/Converter as Webservice
* Integration with Atlassian Confluence (for Testcase and Testrun definitions)
* Better support for oData V4.0 (similar to SOAP)
* Support for GraphQL via Graphene
* Multi-Language interface (I18n)

PRO-Features
------------
So far whatever we do goes into the open source version, so there's no PRO-Version planned currently. Also baangtDB,
the big brother of baangt (WEB-Interface using baangt's core functionality for larger corporations) is purely open source.

Nevertheless we plan to provide these services:

* Consulting
* Priority support
* Testcase creation as a Service
* Testing as a service
